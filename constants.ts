    patternInsight: "PATTERN I — THE FREQUENCY\n\nYour energy is 'Earth' in its most sacred form: solid, reliable, and enduring. Like the mountain, you do not move for the wind; you shape the wind. You are the 'Sanctuary Builder,' possessing a rare gravitational pull that regulates the nervous systems of everyone around you. \n\nPATTERN II — THE RELATIONSHIP\n\nIn connection, you offer 'Architectural Love.' You do not just feel; you do. You anticipate needs before they are spoken, handling the logistics of survival so others have the freedom to dream. You are the stillness in the storm.\n\nPATTERN III — THE CONTRIBUTION\n\nProfessionally, you are the backbone. Where others see chaos, you see a foundation waiting to be laid. You embody responsibility and discipline, turning abstract ideas into tangible reality.",
    blindSpot: "BLOCK I — THE WEIGHT\n\nYour shadow is 'Hyper-Vigilance.' You carry the weight of the world, often believing that if you let go, everything will collapse. This compulsion to protect can turn into rigid control or micromanagement.\n\nBLOCK II — THE SILENT BURNOUT\n\nYou often confuse being needed with being loved. You wait for others to care for you the way you care for them, but your strength makes you look unbreakable. This leads to silent resentment and deep physical exhaustion.\n\nBLOCK III — PATH TO EQUILIBRIUM\n\nYou must learn that boundaries are not walls; they are the structure that makes your love sustainable. True protection includes protecting your own energy. You can be a sanctuary without being the sacrifice.",

You do not fear the dark waters of emotion; you know that is where the pearl is found.\n\nPATTERN II — THE RELATIONSHIP\n\nIntimacy is your oxygen. You are the 'Mirror' that reflects people's truth back to them with compassion. You bind communities together, instinctively knowing how to weave disparate threads into a tapestry of belonging.\n\nPATTERN III — THE CONTRIBUTION\n\nYou lead through 'Inspirational Empathy.' You build cultures of trust where vulnerability is seen as strength. Your superpower is transforming sterile environments into spaces of genuine human connection.",
    blindSpot: "BLOCK I — THE SPONGE\n\nYour boundary is permeable. You do not just witness emotion; you absorb it. When the room is heavy, you become heavy. You often lose the edges of where you end and others begin.\n\nBLOCK II — EMPATHY FATIGUE\n\nTo survive the noise of others' needs, you may periodically shut down, withdrawing into numbness. This creates a painful cycle of over-giving followed by guilt-ridden retreat.\n\nBLOCK III — PATH TO EQUILIBRIUM\n\nYou must develop 'Compassionate Detachment.' Validating another's experience does not require carrying it for them. Your empathy is a gift, not a sentence.",

    patternInsight: "PATTERN I — THE FREQUENCY\n\nYour energy is Solar—radiant, projective, and inherently optimistic. You are the 'Architect of Possibility.' You do not understand the concept of a dead end; to you, it is simply a pivot point.\n\nPATTERN II — THE RELATIONSHIP\n\nYou love through empowerment. You are the cheerleader and the benefactor, believing that rising tides lift all boats. You attract those ready to grow and challenge them to see their own greatness.\n\nPATTERN III — THE CONTRIBUTION\n\nYou are a generator of momentum. When a project stalls, you are the spark plug. You teach the world that abundance is not something you acquire, but a mindset you inhabit.",
    blindSpot: "BLOCK I — THE CHASE\n\nYou have a profound discomfort with stillness. You equate pausing with failing. Beneath your optimism lies a subtle, driving fear of scarcity or 'not enoughness.'\n\nBLOCK II — THE CRASH\n\nYour drive can morph into 'Toxic Positivity,' ignoring red flags to keep the energy moving. Eventually, the adrenaline runs out, leading to sudden, deep depletion.\n\nBLOCK III — PATH TO EQUILIBRIUM\n\nYou must befriend the pause. Rest is not the opposite of creation; it is the soil from which it grows. You attract by being, not just doing.",

    patternInsight: "PATTERN I — THE FREQUENCY\n\nYou are the 'Great Harmonizer.' Your internal rhythm is slow, deep, and deliberate. Like Air, you circulate and clear the atmosphere. You have a natural immunity to drama, preferring the clarity of silence.\n\nPATTERN II — THE RELATIONSHIP\n\nYou are the safe harbor. You offer a non-judgmental presence that allows others to drop their defenses. You create spaces where nervous systems can down-regulate and heal.\n\nPATTERN III — THE CONTRIBUTION\n\nYou lead through 'Diplomatic Consensus.' You are the mediator who can de-escalate high-tension situations without raising a voice. You bring sanity to the frantic.",
    blindSpot: "BLOCK I — THE SILENCE\n\nYour pursuit of peace often morphs into a war against your own voice. You swallow your truth to keep the water still, fearing that conflict will lead to separation.\n\nBLOCK II — PASSIVE WITHDRAWAL\n\nThe pressure of unexpressed emotion leads to 'Passive Withdrawal.' You remain physically present but energetically absent, drifting behind a wall of fog.\n\nBLOCK III — PATH TO EQUILIBRIUM\n\nPeace is not the absence of noise; it is the presence of alignment. You must risk the temporary discomfort of speaking your truth to find true harmony.",

You perceive the world through symbolism and synchronicities, understanding that reality is more porous than it appears.\n\nPATTERN II — THE RELATIONSHIP\n\nYou bond through the spirit. Small talk drains you; you crave conversations about the nature of consciousness and the texture of dreams. You help others see the magic in their mundane.\n\nPATTERN III — THE CONTRIBUTION\n\nYou are the futurist. You connect dots that others do not see. You challenge the status quo not to be difficult, but because you see a higher trajectory.",
    blindSpot: "BLOCK I — THE UNBOUND\n\nYou resist structure, fearing it will trap you. This leaves you ungrounded, with a brilliant mind full of visions that struggle to take root in reality.\n\nBLOCK II — DISSOCIATION\n\nWhen reality becomes too harsh, you escape into fantasy. This 'Spiritual Scattering' leaves you feeling misunderstood and isolated in a tower of high concepts.\n\nBLOCK III — PATH TO EQUILIBRIUM\n\nYou must build a container for your magic. Structure is not a cage; it is the channel through which your vision flows into the world.",
